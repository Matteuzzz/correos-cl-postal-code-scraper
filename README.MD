## üì• Installation

To get started with the **Correos CL Postal Code Scraper**, you need to have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your machine. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Matteuzzz/correos-cl-postal-code-scraper.git
   cd correos-cl-postal-code-scraper
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

To use the scraper, you need to execute the main script. The script will take the postal code as input and return the corresponding information in JSON format.

```bash
python scraper.py <postal_code>
```

Replace `<postal_code>` with the actual postal code you want to look up.

## üîç How It Works

The scraper uses Playwright, a powerful web automation library, to interact with the Correos de Chile website. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the process:

1. **Initialization**: The scraper initializes a headless browser instance.
2. **Form Simulation**: It navigates to the postal code lookup form and fills in the required fields.
3. **Autocomplete Handling**: The scraper waits for the autocomplete suggestions to load, ensuring accurate results.
4. **Data Extraction**: Once the postal code is validated, the scraper extracts the relevant data.
5. **JSON Response**: Finally, the data is structured into a clean JSON format and returned.

## üì° API Integration

This scraper is designed to be easily integrated into your web applications. Here‚Äôs a basic example of how you can set it up with Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from scraper import PostalCodeScraper

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/postal-code', methods=['GET'])
def get_postal_code():
    postal_code = request.args.get('code')
    scraper = PostalCodeScraper()
    result = scraper.lookup(postal_code)
    return jsonify(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, a GET request to `/api/postal-code?code=<postal_code>` will return the postal code information in JSON format.
